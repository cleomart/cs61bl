Our group started the project early but did not expect debugging to take so long. Although we distributed the work equally among the group members and met up almost every day, it was hard to collaborate since we all had different approaches to designing each class and its methods. In addition, the group was not on the same page when working on merge. We were confused about split point and the various merge cases, and after asking for help, we realized that the code was hard to implement and took more time than expected. As a result, we were left with two failed merge cases by midnight, leading us in need of the 24 hour slip time to finish the project.
